# Snack Game

The Snack Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a hungry snake trying to eat as many snacks as possible without colliding with the walls or its own tail. The game is implemented using Python and the Pygame library.

## Game Features

- Simple and intuitive controls: The snake can be controlled using the arrow keys or WASD keys.
- Randomly generated snacks: Snacks appear at random locations within the game window for the snake to eat.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of snacks consumed.
- Increasing difficulty: As the snake eats more snacks, it grows in length, making it progressively harder to avoid collisions.
- Game over condition: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own tail, displaying the final score.

## Prerequisites

To run the Snack Game on your local machine, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Pygame library: The Snack Game relies on the Pygame library for graphics and input handling. You can install it using the following command: `pip install pygame`.
